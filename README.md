Facebook Update TwitterBot README

=============

Purpose:
Unfortunately, many websites change their security configurations without notifying users. Facebook frequently changes their security settings which can cause users’ personal information to become public. Other updates are actually beneficial, but users frequently remain unaware of positive changes as well. I originally wanted to create a chrome extension that notifies users of changes in the websites that they visit security settings. This is obviously a complicated idea that might include using another programming language and learning other skills that I do not currently possess. I have decided to focus on Facebook, and a specific bot to tweet relevant update information, which will be later collected on a blog of the same name.

For this project I am creating a twitterbot that tweets information that might be useful to Facebook users. I have decided to pull this information from Full Disclosure as well as relevant hashtags. 

Useful sources: InventWithPython, misc python bloggers


Scope/Milestones:
Create and set up specific twitter
download python twitter app to new box
Create API key
Edit bot code from downloaded script
Select specific words to follow
Create and set up twitter application
Figure out how to use full disclosure or follow another related twitter
branch out to following related bots and facebook security update twitters


Eventually this project could include sites other than Facebook.
I would also like to have the relevant tweets collected in blog format as well. I am not certain whether this should be part of the current project.

This bot is capable of searching based on certain key terms two different ways. This is the preparation step before it actually has the capacity to perform scheduled tweets. It can search from the command line and then retweet specific terms ex: facebook security. It can also use random search terms through the random module.

This bot is also connected to total disclosure's twitter and facebook security's twitter. I currently have one follower as of 5/1/14.
